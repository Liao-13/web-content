# Partition Key

A partition key is a field that you can specify when creating a collection in Milvus, a new feature that enables faster and more efficient query filtering.

This feature enables Milvus to store entities into different partitions based on their key values. This way, you can group entities with the same key together and avoid scanning irrelevant partitions when filtering by the key field. Partition keys can greatly speed up query performance compared to traditional filtering methods.

## Prepare data

To demonstrate the use of partition keys, we have prepared [a dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/mcdonalds-store-reviews) containing the reviews of McDonald's stores across the U.S., among all the fields of which, `store_address` will be designated as the partition key.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('McDonald_s_Reviews.csv', encoding="cp1252")
df.to_json('McDonald_s_Reviews.json', orient='records')
```

The raw dataset is in a CSV file, and the above code changes it to a JSON file. Then, we use **text2vec** to convert the review text to corresponding vectors and save the vectors side by side with the review text in each record.

```python
import json
from text2vec import SentenceModel

model = SentenceModel('shibing624/text2vec-base-multilingual')
with open('McDonald_s_Reviews.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    
    reviews = [ x['review'] for x in data ]
    review_vectors = model.encode(reviews)

    for i in range(len(data)):
        data[i]['vector'] = review_vectors[i].tolist()

with open('McDonald_s_Reviews.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f)
```

## Create Collection

Once the dataset is ready, we can set up a collection by connecting to Milvus and designing its schema.

```python
from pymilvus import connections, Collection, FieldSchema, CollectionSchema, DataType, utility

connections.connect(host='localhost', port='19530')

# reviewer_id,store_name,category,store_address,latitude ,longitude,rating_count,review_time,review,rating

fields = [
    FieldSchema(name='reviewer_id', dtype=DataType.INT64, description="", is_primary=True),
    FieldSchema(name='store_address', dtype=DataType.VARCHAR, description="", max_length=512, is_partition_key=True),
    FieldSchema(name='review', dtype=DataType.VARCHAR, description="", max_length=16384),
    FieldSchema(name='vector', dtype=DataType.FLOAT_VECTOR, description="", dim=384, is_index=True),
]

schema = CollectionSchema(
    fields=fields, 
    description="", 
    enable_dynamic_field=True, 
    # The following is an alternative to setting `is_partition_key` in a field schema.
    partition_key_field="store_address"
)

collection = Collection(
    name='McDonald_s_Reviews',
    schema=schema,
    # The number partitions to create are 64 by default. Set it to a proper value that you see fit.
    num_partitions=100
)

collection.create_index(
    field_name='vector', 
    index_params={
        # Use your favorite metric type
        "metric_type": "L2", 
        # Use your favirote index type
        "index_type": "IVF_FLAT", 
        "params": {"nlist": 128}
    }, 
    name='vector_idx'
)
collection.load()

utility.list_collections()

# Output
# ['McDonald_s_Reviews']
```

If the above code snippets output the name of the collection, it is ready to accept data from the prepared dataset.

Before that, there are several things you should know more about:

- Enable partition key

  - Use the `is_partition_key` setting on a specific field.
  - Alternatively, specify the `partition_key_field` in the collection schema.

- Set the number of partitions

  - The `CollectionSchema` object has a `num_partitions` argument. This determines how many partitions will be created in the collection.
  - When you set this alongside an enabled partition key, the system creates the specified number of partitions during collection creation. Once set, you cannot modify (add or delete) these partitions.
  - By default, `num_partitions` is set to `64`, but you can adjust this according to your needs.

- Milvus's data distribution strategy

  - Every entity inserted into Milvus gets hashed. The partition that will store this entity is determined based on its hash value.

  - If a search request includes boolean expressions related to the partition key, Milvus will hash that specific partition key to filter and identify the relevant partition. This narrows down the search scope, making searches faster and more efficient.

For other possible options for `metric_type` and `index_type`, please refer to [Similarity Metrics](metric.md), [In-memory Index](index.md) and [On-disk Index](disk_index.md).

## Insert Data

We now need to read the prepared JSON file into memory and insert it directly into the collection as follows:

```python
with open('McDonald_s_Reviews.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    collection.insert(data)

print(collection.num_entities)

# Output
# 33396
```

Then you can check the number of inserted entities using `collection.num_entities`. In this example, the dataset contains over 33000 entities.

## Conduct an ANN Search

To conduct an ANN search using the partition key, you should include either of the following in the boolean expression of the search request:

- `expr='<partition_key>=="xxxx"'`
- `expr='<partition_key> in ["xxx", "xxx"]'`

Do replace `<partition_key>` with the name of the field that is designated as the partition key.

```python
result = collection.search(
    [data[0]['vector']], 
    anns_field='vector', 
    param={'nprobe': 16}, 
    limit=10, 
    expr=f"store_address=='{data[0]['store_address']}'", 
    output_fields=['store_address', 'review', 'rating']
)

for hits in result:
    for hit in hits:
        print(hit)

The evening staff is very pleasant, but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired, as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in Spanish out in the open which, being a light skinned Puerto Rican, I understand perfectly.

## Partition-key-based Multi-tenancy

You can use the partition key feature to achieve multi-tenancy with better search performance. 

To do this, you can assign a tenant-specific value as the partition key field for each entity. Then, when you search or query the collection, you can include the partition key field in the boolean expression to filter entities by the tenant-specific value. This way, you can isolate data by tenants and avoid scanning unnecessary partitions.

To learn more about multi-tenancy strategies, read [Multi-tenancy](multi_tenancy.md) for details.
